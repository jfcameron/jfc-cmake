# 
# \brief the add_dependency module provides a way for THIS project to include external code according to a recepie maintained in THIS project.
# It it the way to pull in external projects that do not make use of the jfc_project module. In the jfc_project case, all that needs to be done is to
# include that directory.
#
# add_dependency is more flexible and can be used to pull in any kind of dependency including submodules, archived releases, downloads, plain source, etc.
#
# the same directory in which add_dependecies is called must include files in the same directory that instruct how to build/include that project.
# e.g: dependency "mydependency" requires a file "mydependency.cmake" to exist in the same dir and that file must define library and include path symbols like
# "mydependency_LIBRARIES" and "mydependency_INCLUDE_PATH". Everything else is up to the script and will vary grealty based on the type of dependency etc.
#
# TODO: MUTLIPLE INCLUSION GUARD:
# TODO: Check if this dependency has already been added somewhere else in the dep graph: create a toplevel symbol and check if it exists. if so, log and skip
# TODO: Add a manditory PUBLIC/PRIVATE flag, which decides where to pass along this dependency (does this make sense? dangerous in case of .as)
